In the case study we are using the paper from [Osmundson, Dewell, and Darst (2013)](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0076572). We will use a set of data from the paper in order to develop a prototype of the pipeline using snakemake.

The study was performed in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). MRSA is resistant to broad spectrum beta-lactam antibiotics and lead to difficult-to-treat infections in humans. Lytic bacteriophages have been suggested as potential therapeutic agents, or as the source of novel antibiotic proteins or peptides. One such protein, gp67, was identified as a transcription-inhibiting transcription factor with an antimicrobial effect. To identify S. aureus genes repressed by gp67, the authors expressed gp67 in S. aureus cells. RNA-seq was then performed on three S. aureus strains:

* RN4220 with pRMC2 with gp67
* RN4220 with empty pRMC2
* NCTC8325-4
